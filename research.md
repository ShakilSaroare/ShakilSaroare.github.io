  <p align= "justify"> 
    Using many instruments comes with a price as additional instruments increases finite sample bias or variance or both. On the other hand, additional number of instruments leads to an increase in asymptotic efficiency and accuracy of estimators. In this paper, I use simulation model with independent, relevant, and excluded instruments jointly comprising complete sets of IVs. I focus on quantifying the finite sample performance of estimators after omitting instrument(s) from these complete sets. To do that, I identify a set of structural models from the econometric literature and design Monte Carlo (MC) experiments to measure sensitivity of outcomes. In finite samples, I find that the bias and variance of estimators increase due to the exclusion of instrumental variables. I also find that the MSE increases with the increase of number of omitted instruments in the model. I then evaluate the situation where our simulated data is re-sampled to analyze whether increasing the sample sizes could offset the effect of missing instruments. I find that although the increase in sample size reduces the MSE overall, the increase in sensitivity with the number of omitted instruments is not necessarily eliminated by increases in sample size. I also find that from a system perspective, relative to a single equation, the equations with more endogenous variables appear more sensitive due to the omitted instruments. I find that the loss of instruments with strong relevance cannot be recovered by including instruments with weak relevance which might indicate towards weak IV problem. Finally, I compare the estimates of 2SLS and 3SLS methods under missing instruments and the results imply that although the finite sample performance of 3SLS estimator under omitted instruments is better than its 2SLS counterpart, the former also has higher MSE under omitted IVs when compared to a complete set of IVs.

    Economic Substitution Between Pesticides and Microplastic
  
  </summary>
    
  <p align="justify">
  Agricultural inputs such as pesticides are used for more efficient production in the short run, but the use of these inputs come with environmental consequences over time. I explore the choices between plastics and pesticides to grow food, as well as the potential negative spillover caused by plastic use in production agriculture that is transformed into microplastic pollution in the soil. My study explores two cases (conventional and unconventional production) to analyze the substitution effect of plastic inputs with pesticides in agriculture. Both imply that a growers’ risk preference has an impact on the substitution between plastic and pesticides in that restrictions on inputs do not necessarily trigger substitution effect for risk averse growers. I also show that a higher cost of restricted pesticide can induce the risk neutral producers to substitute restricted pesticide with plastic mulches (i.e., for weed control). I introduce a restriction on plastic residue which has possible microplastic spillover in the soil and show that this restriction along with high cost associated with biodegradable plastic mulches might incentivize the grower to use more environmentally friendly pesticides.

    Vertically Integrated Equilibrium Model – A small Economy Context
  
  </summary>
    
  <p align="justify">
  Partial equilibrium (PE) analysis is widely used to study direct welfare effect on a particular market at a disaggregated level with minimal data requirement. We argue that the non-interactive market assumptions of PE models, in general, are rarely feasible for a small economy. Therefore, we develop vertically integrated CGE model, which is PE in structure but allows for the circular flow of GE models. We use equilibrium displacement model by total logarithmic differential of the behavioral equations of the CGE model. We focus on measuring and quantifying impacts of exogeneous shocks along the supply chain for the agricultural sector in the context of a small economy. We show the differences between the results of GE and PE analysis is economically significant for a small economy. We also decompose economic welfare effects along the supply chain that are traditionally folded together in a GE model.
